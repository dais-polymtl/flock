Quantum Entanglement in Photosynthetic Organisms: A New Frontier in Bioenergetics

Recent advances in quantum biology have revealed that photosynthetic organisms, such as green sulfur bacteria, may utilize quantum entanglement to enhance energy transfer efficiency. This study investigates the role of entangled excitons in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, a key component of the photosynthetic apparatus. Using ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum simulations, we demonstrate that coherence times in the FMO complex are significantly longer than previously thought, suggesting a biological adaptation to exploit quantum effects. Our findings provide evidence that quantum entanglement may play a critical role in optimizing energy transfer in low-light environments, offering new insights into the evolution of photosynthesis and potential applications in quantum-inspired solar energy technologies.
