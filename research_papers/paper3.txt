Dark Matter Interactions with Neutrino Oscillations: Implications for the Standard Model

The elusive nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing questions in modern physics. This study explores the potential interaction between dark matter particles and neutrino oscillations, proposing a new mechanism by which dark matter could influence neutrino flavor transitions. Using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and advanced Monte Carlo simulations, we identify anomalous oscillation patterns that cannot be explained by the Standard Model alone. Our results suggest that dark matter particles with masses in the MeV range may couple weakly to neutrinos, altering their oscillation probabilities. These findings could provide a pathway to detecting dark matter indirectly and refining our understanding of particle physics beyond the Standard Model.
