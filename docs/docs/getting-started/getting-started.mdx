# Getting Started With FlockMTL

FlockMTL as a DuckDB extension is designed to simplify the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into your data workflows. This guide will help you get started with FlockMTL, covering installation, setup, and basic usage.

We will can summarize the setup process in three steps:
1. **[Install DuckDB](#install-duckdb)**
2. **[Install FlockMTL Extension](#install-flockmtl-extension)**
3. **[Set Up API Keys for Providers](#set-up-api-keys-for-providers)**

## Install DuckDB

To install Duckdb, it's an easy process you need just to visit [DuckDB Installation Page](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/) and choose the installation options that represent your environment, by specifying:

- **Version**: Stable or Preview.
- **Environment**: CLI, Python, R, etc.
- **Platform**: Linux, MacOS or Windows.
- **Download Method**: Direct or Package Manager.

After installing DuckDB, you can verify the installation and get started by following the [DuckDB CLI Overview](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html/).

## Install FlockMTL Extension

At this stage you should have a running DuckDB instance. To install FlockMTL, run the following SQL commands in your DuckDB instance:

```sql
INSTALL flockmtl FROM community;
LOAD flockmtl;
```

This will install the FlockMTL extension and load it into your DuckDB environment.

## Set Up API Keys for Providers

To use FlockMTL functions, you need to set up API keys for the providers you plan to use. FlockMTL supports multiple providers such as **OpenAI**, **Azure**, and **Ollama**.
