# **FlockMTL** a DBMS extension that deeply integrates LLM and RAG capabilities directly into OLAP systems

> **FlockMTL** is a DBMS extension developed within the Data Systems Group (DSG) at Polytechnique Montreal. It is designed to bring analytics & semantic analysis capabilities directly into your SQL queries, deeply integrating the capabilities of language models and retrieval-augmented generation through a set of map and reduce functions.

**FlockMTL** allows users to perform tasks such as text generation, summarization, classification, filtering, fusion, and embedding generation and even end-to-end RAG pipelines within DuckDB.

We believe that relational DBMSs and LLMs are a match made in heaven. We are leaning on the tradition of declarative interfaces to unburden users from lower-level implementation details. Users can query both structured and unstructred datasets while combining analytics and semantic analysis directly within SQL.
